## Overview
For this project, I analyzed the operational aspects of taxi services in Chicago, focusing on the efficiency of taxi distribution among various cab companies and the impact of weather conditions on taxi operations. The primary goal was to understand the adequacy of taxi availability and explore any correlation between weather patterns and taxi trips.

This project required me to use the console to access a remote server. First, I worked with files and directories and then with a taxi service's database.
 ## Task Example

A bug was detected in the system. It appeared twice: first on 30.12.2019 and then again on 31.12.2019. The developers want to investigate the bug by examining logs that contain `400` and `500` error codes. For now, they only want to focus on the first day. My task was to find the logs from the first day, save them in a single file, and split the results into two separate files based on the error code.
## Findings

1. **Taxi Fleet Analysis**:
    - Discovered that the number of taxis in service was below the planned number.
    - Several companies had fewer than 100 cars, indicating potential service gaps.
2. **Weather and Taxi Operations**:
    - Clear patterns were identified, showing the impact of weather on taxi usage.
    - Certain weather conditions, like heavy rain, correlated with a surge in taxi demand.
